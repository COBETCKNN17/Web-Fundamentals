            <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.x. having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).  There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.Js which allow you to add more functionality to a website than simply downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p><br>
            <ul>
               <li><a href="" alt="Variable Declaration">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique name are called identifiers. <span style="color:purple"> var x;</span></li>
               <li><a href="" alt="Variable Assignment">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span style="color:purple">var x = 10;</span></li>
               <li><a href="" alt="Data Types">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span style="color:purple">true</span> or <span style="color:purple">false</span>; null - <span style="color:purple">null</span> aka nothing; Number <span style="color:purple">42</span> or <span style="color:purple">3.14159</span>; String - <span style="color:purple">"Coding Dojo Rocks!"</span>; Array - <span style="color:purple">[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span style="color:purple">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span></li>
               <li><a href="" alt="Conditionals">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditionals that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span style="color:purple">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span style="color:purple">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span style="color:purple">else</span> we execute this block of code</li>
               <li><a href="" alt="Loops">Loops</a> There are many different kids of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!</li>
               <li><a href="" alt="Functions">Functions</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block.Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example, imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finish our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
